* __What is PLUMED-TUTORIALS?__

  PLUMED-TUTORIALS is a living textbook that teaches students about the research done by the members of the PLUMED consortium.
  All members can upload tutorials that explain how methods that they have developed can be used.  Members
  retain control over the lessons they contribute so they can easily keep the content updated. The PLUMED-TUTORIALS website monitors the 
  compatibility of any PLUMED input files within these lessons with the current and development versions of the code and integrates links 
  from these files to the PLUMED manual.  The lessons in the PLUMED-TUTORIALS thus provide a rich set of learning resources that students can
  employ when they first learn to use PLUMED.

* __What is PLUMED?__

  PLUMED is a freely-available, open-source library that provides a wide range of different methods, such as enhanced-sampling algorithms, free-energy methods, and tools to analyze the vast amounts
  of data produced by MD simulations. More information can be found [here](https://www.plumed.org).

* __How to contribute lessons to PLUMED-TUTORIALS__

  Documentation matters! If you have developed a new method and implemented it in PLUMED you should 
  try totry to ensure that there is sufficient information online for others to use your method. A good way to 
  do this is to write a tutorial that explains how to run a calculation using your method.  We thus invite
  everybody to contribute to PLUMED-TUTORIALS. You can do this by providing
  a link to an archive containing a file (in markdown) that provides instructions for students and input files 
  that folks will need to complete your lesson. 
  More detailed instructions and the form to upload a contribution can be found [here](contribute.md).
